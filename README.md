## Dungeon Smith VR: Defender of the Depths

### Concept
Dungeon Smith VR is a **tower defense game** where you are the Dungeon Master defending your lair from waves of NPC adventurers. Use traps, summon minions, and manipulate the environment to stop looters from reaching your treasure.

### Gameplay Mechanics

#### 1. Dungeon Building
- **Trap Placement**: Place traps like spike pits, poison gas vents, or swinging blades to ambush adventurers.
- **Minion Spawning**: Summon skeletons, goblins, or bosses to fight intruders.
- **Environmental Hazards**: Trigger collapses, lava flows, or unleash cursed spirits on enemies.

#### 2. Wave-Based Challenges
- NPC adventurers attack in waves, increasing in number and skill.
- Adventurer classes include:
  - **Warriors**: Tanky frontliners.
  - **Rogues**: Trap disarmers.
  - **Mages**: Long-range attackers who disable traps.
  - **Clerics**: Healers supporting the team.
- Special boss waves feature elite adventurers with unique abilities.

#### 3. Dungeon Resource Management
- Earn resources (gold, mana, or energy) by defeating adventurers or recovering loot.
- Use resources to:
  - Upgrade traps and minions.
  - Unlock and expand new dungeon areas.
  - Purchase spells and environmental hazards.

#### 4. Dynamic Adventurer AI
- NPCs adapt to your defenses:
  - Rogues sneak past traps.
  - Mages disable hazards from afar.
  - Clerics heal their team during encounters.
- Some adventurers focus on treasure, others aim to destroy your dungeon heart.

#### 5. First-Person Dungeon Master Powers
- Use VR controllers to:
  - **Cast Spells**: Lightning, freeze adventurers, or create barriers.
  - **Trigger Traps**: Manually activate traps for maximum effect.
  - **Command Minions**: Direct your monsters to ambush points or targets.

### Key VR Features
- **Immersive Dungeon Design**: Drag and drop traps or minions with VR motion controls.
- **Interactive Combat**: Cast spells and activate traps in real-time.
- **Dynamic Environment**: NPCs react to traps, solve puzzles, and engage minions.
- **Customization**: Personalize your dungeon with themes like haunted castle, volcanic lair, or ancient ruins.

### Progression
- **Unlock New Abilities**: Access advanced traps, stronger minions, and powerful spells.
- **Expand Your Dungeon**: Build deeper lairs with branching paths and decoy treasure rooms.
- **Global Competition**: Share your dungeon online for others to challenge, with leaderboards tracking the best dungeon defenders.

### Vision
Dungeon Smith VR combines strategy, creativity, and immersive VR mechanics to deliver a unique and engaging dungeon defense experience. Build your lair, crush adventurers, and prove you're the ultimate Dungeon Master!

### Future Features
- Multiplayer modes for co-op dungeon defense.
- In-depth adventurer AI personalities.
- VR haptic feedback for enhanced spellcasting and trap activation.
